  ## About/Description

  This project tracks employees through command line prompts.  It allows the user to view the departments, employees, and job roles.  All of this is stored on a MySQL database so it also allows the user to add a new department, role, or employee and update the role of an existing employee.  It does this through the use of Inquirer prompts and displays the data using Console.Table back.  Node.js allows all of this to function through the command line.
